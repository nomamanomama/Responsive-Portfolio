                I have always loved problem-solving and design, and I possess an incessant desire to learn.

            <p>
                I graduated from UT Austin with a degree in Architecture. After several years, I returned to UT Austin 
                to study Computer Science. While in school, I landed a great job as a game developer and pursued software
                development as a new career. 
                When I became a mom, I chose to take a break from my development career to focus on family. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I rejoined the workforce in the field of technical sales where I use my knowledge of development to 
                assist prospective customers in finding the best technical solution for their needs.
                I am currently a member of the software team for an engineering firm in the oil and gas industry.
                 I am once again returning to UT Austin to study full stack web development.
                Becoming a full stack web developer will be an exciting challenge and a perfect way to continue evolving.
